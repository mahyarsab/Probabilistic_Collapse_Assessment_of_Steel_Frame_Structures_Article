# Probabilistic_Collapse_Assessment_of_Steel_Frame_Structures_Article

This paper investigates the seismic performance of intermediate moment-resisting steel frame structures considering the effects of height and soil-structure interaction. For this purpose, three 3D structures of 3-, 6-, and 9-story buildings were designed using CSI ETABS software in accordance with ASCE7-16. Then, the 2D frames of the structures were simulated by OpenSees software, and to account for the nonlinearity of the material, the plastic hinge elements were used. The 2D frames were analyzed using the Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) method subjected to 22 far- eld ground motion records of FEMA-P695. Finally, the fragility curves of the structures were developed. The results illustrated that consideration of soil-structure interaction led to lower spectral acceleration as height increased, meaning that higher-rising structures had record-induced S a(T 1;5%) closer to S a(Design) and upon decreasing height, the difference tended to increase. Exceedance probability decreased with an increase in the structure's height, and consideration of the soil-structure interaction adapts to lower exceedance probability. Moreover, the investigated intermediate moment-resisting steel frame structural models designed according to ASCE7-16 consideration exhibited acceptable seismic performance against far- eld records. Their exceedance probabilities in terms of Life Safety (LS) and Collapse Prevention (CP) performance levels are less than 0.45 and 0.03, respectively.
